Thanks for reading! I hope you got something out of that, even if you're not an Android developer. If you're thinking of using fore in your team for an android project, the fore docs have most of the basics covered in easy to digest sample apps, e.g. [adapters](https://erdo.github.io/android-fore/#fore-3-adapter-example), [networking](https://erdo.github.io/android-fore/#fore-4-retrofit-example) or [databases](https://erdo.github.io/android-fore/#fore-6-db-example-room-db-driven-to-do-list).
